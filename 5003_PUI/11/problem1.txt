Assignment 11

Problem 1

Execution times of searches for one instance:

The naive computation took 199.717478991 seconds
The kdtree computation took 4.73690915108 seconds

I ran the same search on an even smaller subset and the search times
were closer. It appears that in this instance the larger the points to search,
the better KDTree does against the Naive approach.

Pickups are mostly Midtown to Downtown in Manhattan.
