Assignment 11

Problem 3

Execution times of searches for one instance:

The naive computation took 0.00887703895569 seconds
The kdtree computation took 0.812107801437 seconds

In my implementation the Naive approach consistently beat
the performance of of KDTree. I believe this has to do with running
the KDTree on two separate areas (Rectangles) and PERHAPS with
the Naive approach points are quickly discarded for not meeting just
one of the Start Lat/Lng or End Lat/Lng.

I tried running my PY file against varying point counts; Naive always won.
This likely means either that Naive is better for this approach or my
KDTree is overly complex.
