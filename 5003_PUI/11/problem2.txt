Assignment 11

Problem 2

Execution times of searches for one instance (distance  of .003):

The naive computation took 196.926573992 seconds
The kdtree computation took 139.081983805 seconds

I ran the same search on an even smaller subset and the search times
were reversed, the Naive method was quicker than KDTree. 

In the long term, the larger the points to search,
the better KDTree does against the Naive approach.

Pickups are mostly Midtown to Downtown in Manhattan.
