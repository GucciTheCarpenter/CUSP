I was hoping to store the database across several files in order:

1. keep the data persistent once the commands were complete
2. split repetitive data (ie Agency, Salary Frequency)

This proved too ambitious presently.

My solution is the dummed down version that simply writes the final
job postings to ONE text file; this file is later brought whenever the 
program is rerun, this at least retains the instruction to NOT import
duplicate Job ID's.

All of the work after the last set of job postings are imported is done
in memory via multiple lists/dicts.

Additionally, the job posting field names/indexes are created as a persistent
dict within the PY program.
