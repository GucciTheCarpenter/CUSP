	In the scatter plot problems the biggest challenge was keeping the 
'keys' across multiple dicts clear and consistent. This was remeniscent 
of the 'database' assignment. 

	I read through each csv, 311 & zip/pop, only once and created dicts.
	With these dicts I was able to identify zip populations (x) and complaints (y)
by the zip codes themselves, and feed these inputs for scatter plotting.

	With the second problem, 3_2, I followed much the same procedure but
also had to take into account the five prioritized agencies and how to 
display/differentiate them. I decided to go with separate colors for each agency,
leaving as WHITE all circles where one of the five agencies did not appear in the 
complaint/zip, if any.

	My final issue, unresolved, was to get the labels/legend to show. Due
to the way I organized the data I was unable to group the information in an
effective way to get the legend to show. This will of course lead to less 
readability for users not having access to the underlying code. 

	Lastly, this data view is most helpful in the zip codes were complaints 
number in the thousands, any lower and the scale makes it difficult to read
and make differentiations. This is not bad in my opinion for a first pass; 
later on this or similar data sets can be drilled into further or separated
based on complaint counts per zip.
