	I initially considered using pandas for this and all other problems
in this assignment, as per my heading calls that are hashed out, but 
changed course for a few reasons:
	1) It was mentioned in the lab that pandas would be expensive to run.
	2) Stayed away from 'black box' solutions.
	3) Could build on previous work and keep it more Python-y.
So I ended up using dicts and lists to work the data.
	
	Solely based on these bar charts I would say the results help to present
a pre-processing, pre-analysis, perspective where the user is granted top
level numbers to better acquaint themselves with volume of 311 calls and 
the spread across agencies.
